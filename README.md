## üìñ About the Project

`Sufficit.Telephony.EventsPanel.Core` is the core library for the Sufficit Real-time Telephony Events Panel. It contains the essential business logic, data models, and interfaces required to build and interact with a live dashboard displaying telephony activities.

This library is not a UI framework itself but provides the foundational components for both backend services (which process and push events) and frontend applications (which consume and display events).

### ‚ú® Key Features

* Core models for telephony events (e.g., `PanelEvent`, `ChannelStatus`, `QueueInfo`).
* DTOs for communication between backend and frontend (e.g., via SignalR).
* Business logic for interpreting and enriching raw telephony events.
* Interfaces for services that manage the state of the events panel.

## üöÄ Getting Started

This is a core library and is meant to be consumed by other projects. Install it as a dependency via NuGet.

### üì¶ NuGet Package

Install the package via the .NET CLI or the NuGet Package Manager Console.

**.NET CLI:**

    dotnet add package Sufficit.Telephony.EventsPanel.Core

**Package Manager Console:**

    Install-Package Sufficit.Telephony.EventsPanel.Core

> **Note for Developers:** The code samples below use 4-space indentation rather than fenced code blocks (```). This is intentional to prevent rendering issues in certain environments and ensure the raw text can be copied cleanly.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

This library is used by referencing its models and services in your backend event processors or frontend view models.

**Example of a model from the library:**

    using Sufficit.Telephony.EventsPanel.Core;

    public class DashboardViewModel
    {
        public List<ChannelStatus> ActiveChannels { get; set; } = new();

        // This method would be called by a SignalR client or other real-time service
        public void UpdateChannelState(ChannelStatus newStatus)
        {
            var existingChannel = ActiveChannels.FirstOrDefault(c => c.UniqueID == newStatus.UniqueID);
            if (existingChannel != null)
            {
                // Update properties
                existingChannel.State = newStatus.State;
                existingChannel.Duration = newStatus.Duration;
            }
            else
            {
                ActiveChannels.Add(newStatus);
            }
        }
    }
